# Task-03
Java Swing-based Login Page implemented manually in VS Code as Internship Task 3.
# 🔐 Internship Task 3 – Java Swing Login Page

This project is a part of my internship, where I was assigned to design a **Login Page GUI** using Java.  
Instead of using NetBeans drag-and-drop (as originally stated), I chose to **manually implement the UI using Java Swing in VS Code**, which gave me deeper understanding of component layout, event handling, and user interaction.
